# this file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# the data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# examples:
#
#   cities = city.create([{ name: 'chicago' }, { name: 'copenhagen' }])
#   mayor.create(name: 'emanuel', city: cities.first)
